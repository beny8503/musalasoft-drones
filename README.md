## MusalaSoft Practical Test

The application was built using .net 5.0 with Entity Framework Core 5.0.17 with Microsoft Visual Studio Enterprise 2019, Version 16.11.26 for windows.

AutoMapper Extension 12.0.1 was used to work with conversions between DTOs and models.

###Instructions:

To build the solution, load the project into Visual Studio 2019 version 16.11.* or higher. Keep in mind that the target framework is .net 5.0.

Once the project have been built, you can simply run the project by using Visual Studio command tools or going to the output folder, under the net5.0 folder 
usually located under Release/Debug folder just inside bin folder of the project, and executing Drones.exe.

	If you decided to run the application by using Drones.exe, you will see a console application that reprsents the web application server, 
	you can now open you prefered web browser and navigate to https://localhost:5001

The application uses an SQLite database file that it is created in the net5.0 folder, where Drones.exe lives.

Thanks for the opportunity
